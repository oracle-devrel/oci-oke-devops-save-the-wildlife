## About this workshop.

You will learn how to build your infrastructure and automate the build and deployment of a Cloud Native Three.JS application to Oracle Kubernetes Engine(OKE).

Estimated time: 90 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Provisioning Infrastructure using IaC and OCI Resource Manager.
* Build and deploy a microservice based Three.JS onto OCI OKE.
* Bump and rollout new feature to your application.
* Clean up the infra.

### Prerequisites

1. An Oracle Free Tier(Trial), Paid or LiveLabs Cloud Account
1. [Familiarity with OCI console](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/GSG/Concepts/console.htm)
1. [Overview of Networking](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Network/Concepts/overview.htm)

## Cloud Native Applications Overview


"Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.

These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil."


## Oracle DevOps

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure DevOps service provides an end-to-end CI/CD platform for developers. OCI DevOps services broadly cover all the essential needs for a software lifecycle. Such as

- OCI Deployment pipelines  – automate releases with declarative Pipeline release strategies to OCI Platforms like VM and Baremetals, Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) and OCI Functions
- OCI Artifact repositories – A place to store versioned artifacts, including immutable ones.
- OCI Code repositories – OCI provided a scalable code repository service.
- OCI Build pipelines – A serverless, scalable service to automate build, test, artefacts and deployment invocations.




You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
